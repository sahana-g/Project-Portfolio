# Project-Portfolio
Here's some of the stuff I'm working on right now!


# Lab work:
Data Processing:
Just an overview of key processes taken for two separate types of data. The REPIC data is DNA data and sbp data is RNA data of m6a mutation sites. 
Data stored in BED file format, processed for input into neural network. CNN written for sbp data processing can be found under 'Models'.

Models:
Contains final version of neural networks for methyl m6a mutation site prediction. Process is ongoing.
